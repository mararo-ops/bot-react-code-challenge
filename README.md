How to Use the App

    View Bot Collection: Upon loading the app, you will see a collection of bots displayed. Each bot has a "View Details" button that allows you to view detailed specifications of that particular bot.

    View Bot Details: Clicking the "View Details" button for any bot will display its detailed specifications, including its class, abilities, and stats. From the bot details page, you have the option to enlist the bot in your army.

    Enlist a Bot: While viewing the bot details, you can click the "Enlist Bot" button to add the bot to your bot army. Once enlisted, the bot will be added to the "Your Bot Army" section.

    Your Bot Army: The "Your Bot Army" section displays the bots you have enlisted. Each enlisted bot has options to "Release" and "Delete." Clicking the "Release" button will remove the bot from your army and place it back in the available bot collection. Clicking the "Delete" button will permanently remove the bot from the collection.

    Filter by Class: The app provides a filter feature that allows you to filter bots by class. You can use this feature to view bots belonging to a specific class.

Data Source

The bot data is retrieved from a JSON API served from http://localhost:3000/bots. The app fetches this data using the fetch API.
